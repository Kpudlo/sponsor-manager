Booking, scheduling, and Gutenberg blocks for sponsor ads and placements.

== Description ==

Sponsor Manager stores sponsor ads as a custom post type, assigns them to placements, and serves them through the Sponsors block (horizontal or vertical).

Updates are delivered from GitHub Releases (not WordPress.org).

== Changelog ==

= 1.5.1 =
* Ships Updater.php with the PSR-4 filename Linux hosts expect so the plugin can load.

= 1.5.0 =
* Replaces Sponsor Grid and Sponsor Sidebar with one Sponsors block. Choose horizontal or vertical and a maximum number of ads. Existing sidebar blocks still render and convert in the editor.

= 1.4.0 =
* Registers the Sponsor Ad post type, placements, and booking fields in the plugin. ACF / SCF is no longer required and can stay active for other content.

= 1.3.3 =
* Namespaced classes, thin bootstrap, and admin menu registered early so the dashboard nests correctly under Sponsor Manager.
